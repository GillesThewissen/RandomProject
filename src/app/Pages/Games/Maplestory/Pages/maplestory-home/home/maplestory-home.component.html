    <p class="intro">Welcome to the MapleStory section of my website of random stuff. Here you will find things like
        calculators and trackers. The daily and weekly trackers have an option to show the reset times for other regions
        but because i play on GMS the trackers are based on GMS content and events.</p>
    <p class="intro">If you run into any issues, have some suggestions or feature requests feel free to contact me on discord StarLines#0001</p>
